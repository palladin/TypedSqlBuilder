- `retro-console-screenshot.png` - Screenshot of the Northwind RetroConsole example application

To add the retro console screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the running Palladin Shop System console application
2. Save it as `retro-console-screenshot.png` in this directory
3. The README.md will automatically display it

The screenshot should show the retro ASCII art interface with the "PALLADIN SHOP" title and the management system interface.
